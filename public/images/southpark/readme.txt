
 Greetings Fellow South Park fan!  Thank you for downloading the 
 South Park icon collection for Windows 95 (or NT).

 These icons are free, and shall always remain free.  If you don't 
 know how to use them, I'm not going to help.  Your best bet is to
 read the manual for Windows 95 if you haven't a clue what an icon
 does or how to implement it.

 If you're having problems with the icons, download Microangelo at:

  http://www.impactsoft.com/

 Each icon is 256 colors, so you should have the 'show icons using all
 possible colors' option turned on (the Plus! tab in the Desktop 
 Properties).  Of course, you'll need to have your color depth set at 
 High or True color for that to happen.  If you don't have the Plus! 
 tab, you can get it for free from http://www.microsoft.com/truetype/ 
 (look for the free font smoother--it is included with it).  Or, you 
 can download the aforementioned Microangelo 2.1 and it comes with a 
 utility that'll increase your icon color depth, too.

 Visit my 'Just South of South Park' page on the web if you want to see 
 the latest South Park multimedia that I've gathered!
